                <p>
                    Creature 3D (2014), directed by Vikram Bhatt, is an Indian horror film featuring Ahana (Bipasha Basu), who opens a hotel in the hills, only to face a deadly monster inspired by the mythological "Brahmarakshas." As the creature terrorizes guests, Ahana and Kunal (Imran Abbas) uncover its cursed origins and fight to stop it. Known for its 3D effects and suspense, it was a notable attempt at the creature-feature genre in India.
